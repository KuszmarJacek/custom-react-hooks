# Custom React Hooks
This repo consists of custom hooks that might come in handy at some point in the future for me or for someone else. All of them are written in Typescript. The purpose of this repo is to create a pool of hooks so that there is no need to rely on individual npm packages for simple tasks.

## How to run
Simply run ```npm install``` and ```npm run dev``` after cloning the repo.

## Updates
Currently rewriting this repo in Typescript: https://github.com/WebDevSimplified/useful-custom-react-hooks
